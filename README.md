# Linalgebra
*An inefficient, non-optimized, and poorly written linear algebra library in Zig.*

## A haiku describing the state of the repo

> Why does this exist?  
This dumpster fire burns bright.  
I'm just here to learn.

## But actually, why?
Well, the truth is that as of writing this, I have an exam in less than 5 days. What better way to learn linear algebra and deeply understand what each operation does analytically than implement algorithms to do it all from scratch? And while I'm on it, why not learn a new programming language? Zig seems pretty fun.

However, this does mean I rushed everything - good code takes time!

Because of the nature of this repo (I don't know the math too well or the language at all), expect:
- Poor documentation
- Inconsistent coding style
- Inefficient code
- Non-optimally flexible code


Ideally, I'd love to come back and fix all this up as I learn more language concepts and get more comfortable with Zig's orientation towards a more functional paradigm! (Hold me to it)

Anyway, bye bye! Feel free to chuckle at the sheer inanity of some of it~
